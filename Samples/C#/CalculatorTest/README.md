# CalculatorTest

CalculatorTest is a sample test project that runs and validates basic UI scenarios on Windows 10 built-in **Calculator** application. This sample is created as the most basic test project to quickly try out Windows Application Driver.

This test project highlights the following basic interactions to demonstrate how UI testing using Windows Application Driver work.
- Creating a modern UWP app session
- Finding element using name
- Finding element using accessibility id
- Finding element using XPath
- Sending click action to an element
- Retrieving element value
- Navigating using SplitViewPane
