# CortanaTest

CortanaTest is a sample test project that runs and validates basic UI scenarios on Windows 10 built-in **Cortana** application. This sample demonstrates the use of [Desktop Session](../../../README.md#creating-a-desktop-session) and [creation of a new session from a top level window](../../../README.md#attaching-to-an-existing-app-window). In this sample, the **Desktop Session** is used to launch and locate **Cortana** window which the **Cortana Session** will attach to.

This test project highlights the following Windows Application Driver feature.
- Attaching to an Existing App Window
- Creating a Desktop Session
- Sending system keyboard shortcut such as Windows Key + S
- Sending keyboard input to a rich edit box
- Finding element in Edge based WebView
